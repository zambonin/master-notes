\textbf{Abstract.} Cryptography based on multivariate equations are one of main the approaches for creating algorithms that are quantum-resistant. Nonetheless, digital signature schemes based on these concepts feature impractical key pair sizes, orders of magnitude greater than commonly-used schemes. We identify a special structure on the public key of the Rainbow signature scheme. This strategy can be used to create a key with a partially cyclic construction, reducing its storage requirements by up to a factor of three.

\section{Introduction}

Security in communications is necessary to ensure trust between parties. For example, a handwritten signature may be placed on a document to attest that the signer is in agreement with its contents. This is no exception when considering digital transit of data, like electronic mail or messages between devices. In this context, cryptographic techniques, such as digital signature schemes, must be employed to ensure desirable properties, namely authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. These mathematical frameworks permit a signer to hold a private key and a correspondent public key, uniquely related in the sense that one can decode only what its dual has encoded. Furthermore, to prevent forgery of signatures by a malicious actor, schemes are naturally bound to computational problems that are virtually unsolvable without the private key. Integer factorisation and discrete logarithm are the most common examples, respectively related to the RSA and ECDSA schemes. Yet, such problems are provably computable in polynomial time by a quantum computer~\cite{Shor}. Ergo, post-quantum digital signature schemes are paramount in maintaining secure inter-communications.

One of the approaches for constructing post-quantum schemes is based on systems of linear equations with multiple variables, and is appropriately called multivariate cryptography. Dealing with these systems is generally very efficient, suitable for performance- or energy-constrained devices.
