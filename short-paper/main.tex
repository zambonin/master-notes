\textbf{Abstract.} Cryptography based on multivariate equations are one of main the approaches for creating algorithms that are quantum-resistant. Nonetheless, digital signature schemes based on these concepts feature impractical key pair sizes, orders of magnitude greater than commonly-used schemes. We identify a special structure on the public key of the Rainbow signature scheme. This strategy can be used to create a key with a partially cyclic construction, reducing its storage requirements by up to a factor of three.

\section{Introduction}

Security in communications is necessary to ensure trust between parties. For example, a handwritten signature may be placed on a document to attest that the signer is in agreement with its contents. This is no exception when considering digital transit of data, like electronic mail or messages between devices. In this context, cryptographic techniques, such as digital signature schemes, must be employed to ensure common and desirable properties, namely authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation. These mathematical frameworks permit a signer to hold a private key and a correspondent public key, uniquely related in the sense that one can decode only what its dual has encoded. Furthermore, to prevent forgery of signatures by a malicious actor, schemes are naturally bound to hard computational problems. Number-theoretic problems are commonly used, \emph{e.g.} integer factorization and discrete logarithm.
