\textbf{Abstract.} Cryptography based on multivariate equations are one of main the approaches for creating algorithms that are quantum-resistant. Nonetheless, digital signature schemes based on these concepts feature impractical key pair sizes, orders of magnitude greater than commonly-used schemes. We identify a special structure on the public key of the Rainbow signature scheme. This strategy can be used to create a key with a partially cyclic construction, reducing its storage requirements by up to a factor of three.

\section{Introduction}

Security in communications is necessary to ensure trust between any number of parties. This is no exception when considering forms of digital exchange of data, such as electronic mail or messages between devices. In this context, cryptographic techniques must be employed to ensure secrecy, availability, confidentiality etc. of the information, as agreed between the parties.
